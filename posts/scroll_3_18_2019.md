I get caught in the scroll. Refreshing Instagram, Reddit, Hacker News, The NY Times, whatever, I scroll.
Sometimes the scroll moves sideways, like Netflix.

Time enjoyed is not time wasted, but sometimes I don't even enjoy the scroll. I scroll because it's the default.

Move apps around or change up the notifications. Defaults are dangerous, and not just for our precious free time.
